        <p> You may use this template in any way you please, just leave the link at the <br> bottom of the
            page back to me. I love to see how and where my templates are <br>
            used, so feel free to email me from my site BryantSmith.com. I also offer<br>
            professional design, programming, and marketing services, so if you need<br>
            something a bit more complex, or need help with this template, I'd be happy to<br>
            help. I design these templates for free to help those you may not have the time or<br>
            budget for a full scale custom site, but always appreciate small donations for my<br>
            services (paypal: paypal@bryantsmith.com). Thank you, and enjoy the template! </p>
        <h2>Customizing the columns</h2>
        <p>All of the left and right columns have been created so that you can either have<br>
            one continues box that goes all the way to the bottom, or several different boxes<br>
            in each column, however you like it. To make multiple columns, <b>select the divs</b><br>
            'leftcol' and 'leftcol_bottom', copy, and paste the below the current ones (still<br>
            inside of the 'leftcol_container' div). This will create an exact copy of your column<br>
            directly underneath your current one. The left menu is an example of a long single<br>
            div, while the right is multiple divs using the above method.</p>

        <p>This process is exactly the same for the main column (replace 'maincol' for<br>
            'leftcol') and the right as well ('rightcol' instead of 'leftcol'). The site looks good<br>
            either way you do it, so experiment around with what works best for you. The box<br>
            below this one shows what an additional main column looks like (as opposed to a<br>
            long single one)</p>
        <h2>More Template Information</h2>
        <p>If you want to change the picture at the top to something else, the easiest way to<br>
            do this would be to overwrite the current image (located at: /images/picture.jpg)<br>
            with your own JPEG image. Just make sure to keep the same dimensions of<br>
            900x237. The headings in all the columns are < h2> tags, and are automatically<br>
            formatted for you.</p>
